## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Hacktivist

To prevent IDOR attacks I used laravels ORM for example if the user wants to see information about his profile it only displays information
about the currently logged-in user. This can be check in the ProfileController.php file. 

To prevent snooping laravel uses the HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data that is being sent between the client and the server.

To prevent session hijacking laravel uses a session token that is stored in the session cookie. This token is regenerated every time the user logs in. It can be checked in the AuthenticatedSessionController.php file.

# Testing

The two user stories i tested are:

### User Story 1

As a registered user, I want to be able to log in and view the dashboard.

### User Story 2

As a registered user, I want to be able to edit my profile.

## Test Plan

### User Story 1

**System Test**: Tests that the user can suscessfully log in and view the dashboard.

**Unit Test**: Tests that the login function successfully authenticates the use r.

### User Story 2

**System Test**: Tests that the user can successfully navigate to the edit profile page and edit their profile.

**Unit Test**: Tests that the update function successfully updates the users profile.
